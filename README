Oscar's Task Board

NOTE: This application is not usable right now. I'm updating it to enable multiple users/projects.

Description: A simple task board to help managing software projects. It is developed in PHP and uses the CodeIgniter Framework.
Installation: Create the database using db/create.sql, place the filed in your server and run <server>/install (where <server> should be your localhost or domain).
