It lets you create multiple users\r\nand associate them with different projects. Inside each project you can create multiple\r\ntasks.\r\n\r\nIt is developed in PHP and uses the CodeIgniter Framework. Since version 2.0 it also uses Twitter Bootstrap.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nCreate the database using db/create.sql, place the files in your server and update the following:\r\n\r\n* application/config/config.php: update $config['base_url'] with your url.\r\n* application/config/database.php: update your database information.\r\n* .htaccess in your root folder: update /task_board/index.php with your URL.\r\n* enable mod_rewrite in your Apache server.\r\n\r\nRun <server>/install (where <server> should be your localhost or domain/folder).\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems let me know.\r\n\r\n## Next updates\r\n\r\nI plan to update some portions of this application in the following months. Currently these are the features to be developed:\r\n\r\n* Moving tasks: tasks need to ask for new user and comment when moved from In Progress to Testing.\r\n* Pagination: paginate tasks in the dashboard and the list of users.\r\n* Tasks estimation: add an estimation field to enable a comparison between estimated and realised.\r\n* Send emails: When a task is associated with a different user and Periodic email notifying used about his tasks\r\n* ... if you have any ideas, let me know ...\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### 2.0\r\n\r\n* Twitter Bootstrap: app totally redesigned using Twitter Bootstrap\r\n\r\n### 1.4.1\r\n\r\n* Hide Task in Parent List: When editing a task, it shouldn’t appear in the Parent dropdown, otherwise it can be its own parent.\r\n* Show Parent Task: In the taskboard it needs to show the parent task name as well, otherwise two tasks can have the same name and be hard to identify.\r\n* Completed Tasks: Order finished tasks by most recent updated to the older one.\r\n* Convert Line Breaks into HTML: Use nl2br to convert descriptions.\r\n\r\n### 1.4\r\n\r\n* User Profiles: user profiles were added, with a button where the user can ad hist photo, name and social media links (Twitter, Facebok, Linkedin…)\r\n\r\n### 1.3.4\r\n\r\n* Validation: added rules for other fields, in order to enable the set_value function.\r\n* Buttons CSS: changes in the buttons CSS with the inclusion of <i> tag.\r\n\r\n###1.3.3\r\n\r\n* Task Duration: updated in order to save the user.\r\n* Task History: functionality to display the complete history of a task.\r\n\r\n### 1.3.2\r\n\r\n* Bug fix: projects, tasks and users could be created with empty information.
